## About Me
My name is Coda Beatrix, a Swift Developer with a specialized focus on Bitcoin Cash technologies. With extensive experience in developing robust software solutions within Apple's ecosystem, I am dedicated to contributing to projects that emphasize economic freedom through the use of Bitcoin Cash.

## My Focus
**Bitcoin Cash Development in Swift**: My expertise lies in integrating Bitcoin Cash functionalities into Swift applications, leveraging its potential to offer fast, cheap, and reliable peer-to-peer transactions. My commitment aligns with the principles outlined in Satoshi Nakamoto's original white paper, advocating for a truly decentralized electronic cash system.

## Projects
- **SwiftFulcrum**: A Swift framework that incorporates the Fulcrum protocol, enabling developers to craft applications with advanced Bitcoin Cash features. Its type-safe API ensures seamless interactions with Fulcrum servers, catering to both new projects and the enhancement of existing ones.
- **Opal Base**: An open-source library designed for the Apple ecosystem, facilitating the integration of Bitcoin Cash transactions into Swift applications. It encapsulates modern Swift paradigms, offering a secure and efficient mechanism for handling BCH transactions and adhering to the BIP-39 standard for mnemonic seed address generation.
